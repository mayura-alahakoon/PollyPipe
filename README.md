Scenario : 
Polly Pipe is a water sports provider and installer based in Braintree, England. They need you to design and implement a database that meets the data requirements. These necessities are defined in this scenario and below are samples of the paper records that the Polly Pipe preserves.
Polly Pipe is focused in placing aquariums at business customers. Customers can request several installations, but each installation is tailor-made for a specific customer. Facilities are classified by type. One or more employees are assigned to each facility. Because these facilities are often very large, they can include carpenters and masons as well as water installers. The facilities use equipment such as aquariums, air pumps and thermostats. There can be multiple computers in a facility.

In this case I identified the user and system requirements to desgin a database for the PolyPipe and designed a relational database system using conceptual design (ER Model) by including identifies (primary keys)pf entities and cardinalities, participations of relationships. After that I was covered the ER Model into logical database using relational database model including primary kets , foreign keys and referential Intergrities and I did it normalised.

Developed a relational database system according to the ER diagram thatcreated (Used SQL DDL statements) and created a simple interface to insert, update and delete data in the database. Implemented proper security mechanisms in the developed database.
